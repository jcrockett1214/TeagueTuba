            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Colin Teague, and I’m a passionate Tuba player with a deep love for music and performance. I have always believed that music has the power to connect people, and the Tuba, with its rich, resonant sound, allows me to be a part of that connection in a unique and fulfilling way.

I completed my Music Education degree at the University of Kentucky, where I gained a solid foundation in music theory, performance, and education. I was fortunate to work with incredible professors and musicians who helped shape my understanding of music and its many facets.

Currently, I am pursuing my Master’s degree at Florida State University, where I continue to expand my knowledge and skills. At FSU, I am also honored to assist in conducting the Tuba Ensemble, where I help guide and inspire fellow musicians. It’s a rewarding experience to not only perform but also contribute to the growth of other talented Tuba players.

I am deeply committed to both performing and teaching, and I hope to continue to inspire and educate others through the art of music. Whether through solo performances, ensemble work, or teaching, I strive to bring my passion for the Tuba to every note I play.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to sharing my music and journey with you!</p>
